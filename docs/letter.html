          <h2>The Runbooks Manifesto</h2>
          <p class="sample">This is the Runbooks Manifesto: the reason why I built Runbooks. After years of struggling with
wikis and word docs instead of a proper solution for my team's documentation, I went out and built
my own solution. I'm convinced that every person or team which is seriously interested in improving
should be using a checklist or runbook. If you are having trouble justifying the time to write such
documents, or are having trouble convincing others, read on...

          <h2>When Should I Make a Runbook?</h2>
          <p class="sample">You've finally decided your team really needs to start writing down how they do different things.
Maybe someone left the team, and there was a frantic rush to transfer knowledge. Maybe you've gotten
fed up with having one too many costly mistakes in some complicated process. Whatever the reason,
you're determined that things are going to be different next time, and that means writing things
down. But, where do you start?
          </p>
          <p class="sample">For describing step-by-step processes, there's nothing quite so ideal as a runbook. They are a kind
of checklist which provides clear, precise instructions for experts while simultaneously

          <h2>Starting a Runbook from Scratch</h2>
          <p class="sample">Starting with a blank page can be daunting. Fortunately, when writing a runbook, you have a head
start: the actual process you want to document. Chances are, you already know how to do that process
rather well, and doing the same thing you always do is a great way to begin writing the runbook.

          <p class="sample">This guide describes multiple levels of refinement when writing a runbook. You can stop at any level
and still have a useful product. In fact...
